# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

## 🚀 About Me

Cloud & DevOps engineer with a strong background in large-scale systems and distributed architectures.  
I design and build **production-ready, observable, and cost-efficient cloud platforms**, with a pragmatic approach to automation and infrastructure engineering.

My work focuses on:

- ☁️ Cloud Architecture  
- ⚙️ DevOps & Platform Engineering  
- 🤖 AI-driven systems  
- 🌐 Distributed infrastructure  

I care about **clean architecture, operational excellence, scalability, and real-world constraints** (cost, resilience, maintainability).

# 🌟 Featured Project – CloudRadar

**CloudRadar** is my end-to-end showcase project.

It is designed as a **realistic production-grade platform**, close to what we build in enterprise environments.

## 🎯 What It Demonstrates

- Real-time **ADS-B aviation data ingestion**
- Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform**
- Kubernetes orchestration (k3s)
- GitOps deployment using **ArgoCD**
- Secret management via **External Secrets Operator**
- Observability stack (**Prometheus + Grafana**)
- Cost-aware architecture (FinOps mindset)
- Cloud-agnostic design principles

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

- Minimal reliance on managed services  
- Reduced vendor lock-in  
- Reproducible infrastructure  
- Observable by design  
- Security-first configuration  

> Build small. Scale smart. Observe everything.

# 🧠 Engineering Mindset

I’m motivated by:

- Turning complexity into structured, automated systems  
- Designing architectures that handle real-world traffic  
- Bridging development and operations cleanly  
- Building systems that are observable and measurable  

Technology should be **robust, scalable, and maintainable** — not just innovative.
